# Slop — Chrome Web Store Listing

## Version
**1.0.0** (First Release)

---

## Short Description (132 char max)
Your AI conversations are scattered. Slop captures, summarizes, and injects your knowledge back — across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini & Copilot.

---

## The Problem

Every time you start a new chat with AI, it has no idea who you are.

You already told ChatGPT about your project last week. You already explained your coding setup to Claude yesterday. You already walked Gemini through your business plan this morning.

But none of them remember. So you explain it all over again. And again. And again.

It's like having a coworker with amnesia. Every conversation starts from scratch.

**Your best ideas, decisions, and breakthroughs are trapped in old chats you'll never find again.**

---

## The Solution

**Slop gives your AI a memory.**

It watches your conversations (locally, on your machine — not in the cloud), pulls out the important stuff, and saves it. Then, the next time you're chatting with any AI, Slop shows you what it already knows about the topic — and lets you drop it right into the conversation with one click.

Think of it like this:
- You talk to AI every day
- Slop takes notes for you
- When the topic comes up again, Slop hands you the notes
- You paste them in, and now the AI is caught up instantly

**No more repeating yourself. No more lost context. No more starting over.**

---

## How It Works (4 Simple Steps)

**1. You chat like normal.**
Use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Copilot — Slop works on all of them. You don't change anything about how you work.

**2. Slop takes notes in the background.**
It captures your conversations and summarizes them — pulling out key decisions, insights, code, and topics. All automatically.

**3. Slop reminds you when it matters.**
Next time you're in a chat, a small icon appears on the side. Click it, and Slop shows you everything relevant from your past conversations.

**4. One click to inject.**
See something useful? Click it. Slop drops the context right into your chat, formatted perfectly for whichever AI you're talking to.
